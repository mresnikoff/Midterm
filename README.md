# Information Architechture

Ontology - The things that are important in my website in terms of the way that it's structured is the format in which Federer is presented to the user. The home page builds him up to be extremly special, and then once you move on to the actual content you can see just why he's so special due to the way his background, accomplishments, and legacy are described. I thought that using those three as my bullet points would help iterate my point well.

Choreography - As stated above, my home page leads into the content where there are three main sections, his personal background, his accomplishments in the sport, and his legacy to the game in that order. I did that for a specific reason. I thought that first understanding his background could help the readers understand who he is and then his greatness would make more sense. Then I go into his long long long list of great accomplishments and the reader gets to finally grasp just why he is the goat. And then finally I go into his legacy and it makes sense to the reader. It wouldn't have made sense in any other order.

# Design

Z-Pattern - I used the Z-Pattern on my home page and I really love how it turned out. In the top left corner I have Federer's autograph and it looks phenomanal. In the top right I have a link to his wiki, bottom left I have a little lead in to his greatness that reads "Undoubtably the best tennis player of all time Maybe the best athlete of all time." and in the bottom right I have a link to the next page that says to click if you want to learn more about the goat. It made sense to put the autograph in the top left and the little tidbet in the bottom left for asthetic purposes. The link to his wiki in the top right and link to the next page in the bottom right are pretty interchangable but i had both in both spots and this just looked best to me. 

F-Pattern - The next page has three F-Patterns, one for each section (background, accomplishments, and legacy). Each picture I picked coencides with it's section besides the first (it was tough to find something good to represent his background so I just decided to do his backhand instead).The flashy tweener picture goes with accomplishments well and the picture of him holding up his 20th major trophy goes well with legacy. 

C.R.A.P. - My webpage does a good job at showing contrast, repetition, and allignment. The contrast can be seen easily by the colors that I themed it with, red and black, and I also used those colors for a reason, they are Federer's favorite color schema (red and white would've also been good but the contrast looks better with black). Repetition is shown in the three F-patterns on my second page, section with a picture to the right. And allignment is shown in the way the images and sections are alligned on the second page, I altered the images respective widths specifically for this reason. 

Fonts - On page 1 I went with the Bellefair font because I wanted something big and scripty looking when I wrote "Roger Federer" as his autograph is similarly scripty looking and I liked the contrast between the two when they were so close in proximity. On page 2 and for the non-title on page 1 I went with the Playfair font because I wanted a blockier looking font for the sections. I thought it looked very readable and went well with the colors too. 

CSS Architecture - I stared by laying out the base, but from there I moved on to the layout, from there the modules and then finally the state (organized the z-patterns and what not).

Database info - 

database host = "66.147.242.186"
database buser = "urcscon3_resniko"
database password = "Tennis101"
database bname = "urcscon3_resnikoff"

Troubles/Interesting things - So I really didn't have any pressing technical difficulties with my webpage. I do like the way that when you hover over Fed's signature the background has like a hint of red, to me that looks very cool, but no technical difficulties that I'm aware of exist.
